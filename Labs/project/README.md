## Project objectives

Objective of this project is to use previous experience to implement the hall sensor to measure the speed and distance on the exercise bike
and to use this implementation, so the console, which we will make, will show us the results, f.e. the distance traveled, or used speed.

## Hardware description

For this project we are using counter and clock enable with added hall sensor entity. The project is implementable on Arty A7-35T board.
